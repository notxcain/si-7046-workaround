https://issues.scala-lang.org/browse/SI-7046 workarounds   
This project demonstrates how to workaround SI-7046 when using `shapeless.Generic[T]` derivation.  
Or any other macro which uses `knowDirectSubclasses`.
Just open project in your favorite IDE and you will see the pattern in package relative position of derivation and corresponding compilation success.
